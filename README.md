DAILY PLANNER

1. Overview

The Daily Planner lets users plan out their day hour-to-hour. The top of the page displays the current date and time, and the rest of the page is primarily cut up into hourly timeblocks. Users may input their schedule into each hour slot. The application color codes each timeblock based on if it has passed, it is current, or is future. The application also saves things into local storage, so users may leave the page and come back. The tasks reset if the day changes.
